Passionate UI/UX Designer and an upcoming Computer Science graduate, skilled
in Figma, Photoshop, React.js, and TailwindCSS. I love creating intuitive, user- centered designs that blend creativity with functionality bringing fresh energy
and innovation to every project. Passionate in learning new concepts and tools
that may aide the company’s design projects going forward.
